<h2>Research Organization</h2>
<p>
A reputation for excellence in research supported by a high calibre staff is reflected in the demand for
entry to Vellore Institute of Technology's programmes from high achieving students. Committed to
excellence in fundamental research as well as the development of innovative technologies for the
future, VIT offers a quality research training experience for its students. The Institute maintains its
relevance to world-class research by linking with industry and business through local and international
research networks.Within a short time of becoming a University in 2001, VIT has risen to the
expectations of Government organisations, research institutes, mission-critical organisations like
Defence establishments, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and Atomic Research Centres. It
has secured sponsorship for 50 research projects to the tune of Rs 100 million. VIT also offers
consultancy services worth more than Rs 2.2 million to the Defence Research and Development
Laboratory.
