<h2>Campus life</h2>
<p>
A very attempt has been done by the management and other administrative boards to assure that every
student finds VIT a very lively, fun and resourceful community to employ their erudite years. Conscious
of the influence these active years can have on the minds of the expectation of our nation and the
globe, VIT endeavours to promote, introduce and expand any and all ventures to shape their minds. By
bringing clubs, chapters and college festivals, students are not simply revealed to a competitive
environment inside the university but also with reputed universities and colleges in and around the
country.
A home away from home, the hostels at VIT is more than four walls and a roof. They have been designed
to provide a comfortable, safe, inclusive and secure living even as they provide opportunities to form
lasting friendships and ease the transition from home to college. Residential staff is always available to
support the students from different backgrounds to promote community. Living on campus provides
students with opportunities to: * Connect with a diverse population of people * Develop stronger
interpersonal and communication skills * Engage in campus leadership, organizations and activities *
Establish relationships with faculty and staff members Hostel review committee meetings are conducted
once in 15 days by the hostel administrators to address studentsâ€™ queries and requirements, and to keep
them updated on upgradation of services and events. Students are also given the privilege to give
suggestions to improve the hostel facilities.
